# StackOverflow
## Using EDA, help Stack Overflow implement the following features in its web application:

1. When a user raises a question with a data science tag ('python', 'r', 'matlab', 'sas', 'excel', 'sql'), then Stack Overflow sends the notification to the relevant users.

2. When a user provides a data science tag ('python', 'r', 'matlab', 'sas', 'excel', 'sql') to their question, then Stack Overflow should come up with the expected approximate        time to get it answered.

3. While a user raises a question, Stack Overflow wants to provide some suggestions to the users to get their queries answered quickly.
